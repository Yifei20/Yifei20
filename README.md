### Hi there 👋

- 👨‍🎓 I'm currently an undergraduate student of XJTLU.
- 📚 I'm currently doing research on Meta Learning based Few-shot Fault Diagnosis.
- 📝 I'm reconstructing my personal website, with
  - a blog site *in Chinese* (under development: *yeefay.top*)
  - a academic resume page (future plan)
